# Activity instructions

 - Uninstall the `ggplot2` package.
 - Fork this repo (like you did in the *Fork this!* activity) to create the Project on your own laptop.
 - Note the files and folders that are created.
 - Try to run `script.R` without installing anything.
 - Now run `renv::restore()` to install the missing package(s) and note the added files and folders.
 - Run `script.R` again.
 
## Stretch goals

 - In another project on your laptop, initialise `renv` to create a list of R packages (and their versions) used by the project.
 - Make the project rely on more packages, then get `renv` to update the list.
