# Activity instructions

 - Uninstall the `ggplot2` package.
 - Fork and clone this repo (like you did in the *Fork this!* activity) to create the Project on your own laptop.
 - Note the files and folders that are created.
 - Try to run `script.R` without installing anything.
 - Now run `renv::restore()` to install the missing package(s) and note the added files and folders.
 - Run `script.R` again.
 
## Stretch goal: add renv to an existing project

 - Open the `forkthis` repo again and try to knit the file `nice-plot.Rmd`.
 - Initialise `renv` to create and install the R packages used in this project.
 - Try again to knit the Rmd file.
 - Make the project rely on more packages, then use `renv` to update the list of required packages.
 - Uninstall one of the required packages, then use `renv::restore()` to re-install it.
